# PolinRider Org Cleanup Tool

Scans every repo in a GitHub org for PolinRider malware, removes payloads,
and opens a PR per infected repo — all inside an isolated Docker container.

> Want to scan a **single repo inside CI** instead of sweeping a whole org?
> Use the [**GitHub Action**](#use-as-a-github-action) — it reuses the same
> detection engine to fail a check, auto-clean, or open a cleanup PR.

## What it does

For each repo in your org:

1. **Clones** the default branch (shallow, `--depth=1`, git hooks disabled)
2. **Scans in-process** — reads files as inert text/bytes and pattern-matches known PolinRider signatures. It **never executes** the files it scans (see [Runtime hardening](#runtime-hardening)). Detection is _content-confirmed_: a repo is marked infected only when a real signature matches.
3. **Surgically remediates** infected repos — removing only what is confirmed malicious and preserving legitimate code, tasks, fonts, and configs:
   - **Strips** the appended obfuscated payload (original, rotated + EtherHiding variants) from any `.js/.ts/.mjs` file (config files, `App.js`, `vite.config.js`, …), keeping everything before the payload byte-for-byte
   - **Removes the entire `.vscode` directory** when any task/launch entry is malicious — `curl … | bash`, `runOn: folderOpen` auto-runs, C2 hosts, or running an interpreter against a font/asset (e.g. `node ./public/fonts/x.woff2`)
   - **Removes font carriers strategically.** A font is a _confirmed carrier_ only when it is unreferenced, fails structural font validation (no valid magic / table directory — real fonts, including commercial `.otf` files with embedded license URLs and binary blobs, are trusted), _and_ contains an appended code payload. When a carrier is found, the scanner removes the carrier plus the whole Font-Awesome-named disguise set (`fa-brands/solid/regular-…`) and its `README.md`, while **preserving clean, non-`fa-` fonts in the same directory** (only the leaf `fonts/` dir is removed if nothing clean remains). `fa-`-named fonts with **no** payload are flagged `suspicious` for manual review — never auto-removed.
   - **Deletes** `temp_auto_push.bat`, `temp_interactive_push.bat`, `config.bat`, `branch_structure.json`
   - **Fixes** `.gitignore` (removes all injected lines — `config.bat`, `temp_*.bat`, `branch_structure.json` — re-adds `.env*` patterns) and untracks committed `.env` files
   - **Flags for manual review** (never auto-edits): impostor npm dependencies, fetch-and-exec lifecycle scripts, unknown-but-obfuscated appended code (any global-flag + encoded-payload + eval/spawn shape), and EtherHiding-style blockchain C2-resolution + detached-persistence patterns
4. **Opens a PR** on a new branch with a precise summary of every change — your branch protection rules apply, nothing merges automatically

## Use as a GitHub Action

The same engine is published as a reusable Action that scans the repository being
built — no clone, no org token. Drop it into any workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/malware-scan.yml
name: PolinRider scan
on: [pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: RMSoft-ltd/polinrider-cleanup@v1
        with:
          mode: check # check | fix | pr
```

### Modes

| `mode`              | What it does                                                                                                                               | Typical trigger                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `check` _(default)_ | Scan only. Exits non-zero when malware is found so a **required status check** blocks the merge. No token needed.                          | `pull_request`                   |
| `fix`               | Surgically cleans the working tree. With `commit: true` it also commits + pushes the fix back to the branch (push events only).            | `push`                           |
| `pr`                | Cleans on a new branch and opens a cleanup PR (optionally auto-merged). Works where commit-back can't push (fork PRs, protected branches). | `schedule` / `workflow_dispatch` |

Ready-to-copy workflows live in [`examples/`](examples/).

### Enforce it (block infected merges)

`check` exits `1` on a confirmed infection. To turn that into a merge gate, add the
job as a **required status check**: repo → Settings → Branches (or Rulesets) →
require the `scan` job to pass. PRs then can't merge while malware is detected.

### Permissions

Grant the least your mode needs:

| Mode / feature          | Required `permissions:`                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `check` (no PR comment) | `contents: read`                           |
| PR comment (any mode)   | `pull-requests: write`                     |
| `fix` + `commit: true`  | `contents: write`                          |
| `pr`                    | `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` |
| `sarif-file` upload     | `security-events: write`                   |

### Reporting

Every run writes a Markdown report to the **job summary**, emits inline
**annotations** on the PR diff for each finding, and — on `pull_request` events with
`comment-on-pr: true` (default) — posts the report as a **PR comment** (needs
`pull-requests: write`; skipped with a warning otherwise). Set `sarif-file` to also
emit a SARIF report for the **Security** tab:

```yaml
- uses: RMSoft-ltd/polinrider-cleanup@v1
  with:
    mode: check
    sarif-file: polinrider.sarif
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: always()
  with:
    sarif_file: polinrider.sarif
```

### Excluding known-legit files (and scanning the scanner)

Some repos legitimately contain content that looks like a payload — security
tooling, malware test fixtures, vendored bundles. Use `exclude` to skip those
paths so real infections elsewhere still fail the check:

```yaml
- uses: RMSoft-ltd/polinrider-cleanup@v1
  with:
    mode: check
    exclude: |
      test/fixtures/**
      vendor/**
```

This is how this repo scans **itself** in CI: it excludes only its signature
catalog, payload fixtures, and built bundle (`src/signatures.js`, `test/**`,
`dist/**`) — everything else (real source, configs, `bin/`) is scanned for real,
so an actual infection here would fail the build. Keep the exclude list as tight
as possible; anything excluded is a blind spot.

### Inputs

| Input           | Default                  | Description                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mode`          | `check`                  | `check` · `fix` · `pr`                                                    |
| `path`          | `.`                      | Directory to scan (relative to the workspace)                             |
| `exclude`       | _(none)_                 | Comma/newline-separated paths or globs to skip, e.g. `test/**, vendor/**` |
| `token`         | `${{ github.token }}`    | Token for `pr` mode, `fix`+`commit`, and PR comments                      |
| `fail-on`       | `infected`               | Severity that fails the job: `infected` · `suspicious` · `never`          |
| `commit`        | `false`                  | `fix` mode: commit + push the cleanup back (push events)                  |
| `comment-on-pr` | `true`                   | Post the report as a PR comment on `pull_request` events                  |
| `sarif-file`    | _(off)_                  | Write a SARIF report to this path                                         |
| `dry-run`       | `false`                  | Plan changes without writing/pushing                                      |
| `auto-merge`    | `false`                  | `pr` mode: auto-merge (respects branch protection)                        |
| `merge-method`  | `squash`                 | `squash` · `merge` · `rebase`                                             |
| `branch-prefix` | `fix/polinrider-cleanup` | `pr` mode branch prefix                                                   |

Several inputs also read a legacy **env var** as a fallback (`DRY_RUN`,
`AUTO_MERGE`, `MERGE_METHOD`, `BRANCH_PREFIX`, `POLINRIDER_EXCLUDE`, `SARIF_FILE`),
so you can set them in a workflow/job `env:` block instead of `with:` — handy for
sharing config across steps. An explicit `with:` value always wins. For a custom
token use `with: token:` (it defaults to `${{ github.token }}`):

```yaml
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      AUTO_MERGE: "true"
      MERGE_METHOD: rebase
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: RMSoft-ltd/polinrider-cleanup@v1
        with:
          mode: pr
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Outputs:** `severity`, `infected`, `findings-count`, `changed`, `remediated`,
`pr-url`, `sarif-file`.

### Notes & limits

- **Pin for security.** `@v1` tracks the latest v1.x; pin a full SHA
  (`@<commit-sha>`) if you want immutability.
- **`fix` + `commit` is push-event only.** On `pull_request` it's skipped (detached
  HEAD; fork PRs can't be pushed) — use `mode: pr` there. Commit-back uses the
  default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose pushes don't retrigger workflows (no loop).
- Only **content-confirmed** infections fail by default; impostor deps,
  fetch-and-exec scripts, and the generalized/EtherHiding-fingerprint heuristics
  for unknown variants are flagged for manual review and (in `fix`/`pr`) still
  fail the check since they can't be auto-removed.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine + Compose v2)
- A GitHub **Personal Access Token (classic)** with these scopes:
  - `repo` (full)
  - `read:org`

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone this tool

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd polinrider-cleanup
```

### 2. Create your `.env` file (never committed)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GH_ORG=your-org-name      # an organization…
# GH_USER=your-username   # …OR a personal account (set exactly one)
DRY_RUN=false
```

> **DRY_RUN=true** will scan and remediate locally but skip pushing and PR creation.
> Use this first to verify it does what you expect.

### 3. Build the container

```bash
docker compose build
```

---

## Running

### Dry run first (recommended)

```bash
DRY_RUN=true docker compose run --rm polinrider-cleanup
```

Check the output — it will show every infected file and what would be removed,
without touching GitHub.

### Live run

```bash
docker compose run --rm polinrider-cleanup
```

The tool will print a summary at the end listing every PR URL opened.

## Security design

| Concern                   | Mitigation                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Executing scanned malware | Files read as inert text/bytes; no `require`/`eval`/`exec` of targets; codegen disabled; subprocess allowlist (see below) |
| Token exposure            | Passed via env var only, never baked into image; injected only for `gh`                                                   |
| Host disk access          | Repos cloned to `tmpfs` (RAM only, wiped on exit)                                                                         |
| Root in container         | Non-root user `scanner` (UID 1001)                                                                                        |
| Container capabilities    | All Linux caps dropped (`cap_drop: ALL`)                                                                                  |
| Writable fs               | Root fs read-only; only `/workspace` and `/tmp` writable via tmpfs                                                        |
| Resource abuse            | CPU and memory limits set in `docker-compose.yml`                                                                         |

## Runtime hardening

The scanner only ever **reads** target files as text/bytes — reading a file never
executes it. On top of that architectural guarantee, the tool is hardened in
layers so the obfuscated payload cannot run even by accident:

- **Subprocess allowlist** — only `git` and `gh` may be spawned, with an
  allowlisted set of subcommands. `node`, `npm`, `npx`, `bash`, `sh`, `deno`,
  `python`, etc. are rejected, so a `node -e` / `bash -c` style payload can never
  be launched. Git runs with hooks disabled (`core.hooksPath`), system/global
  config ignored, and `--no-verify`.
- **Code generation disabled** — the launcher (`bin/polinrider.js`) starts Node
  with `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings`, so `eval()` and `new Function()`
  throw.
- **In-code guards** — `src/safety.js` (imported first) also neutralizes `eval`,
  the `Function` family, `require('node:vm')`, and `process.binding`, as a
  fallback when the flag isn't present.
- **No install scripts** — `.npmrc` sets `ignore-scripts=true`; the tool never
  runs `npm install` or a build in a target repo.
- **Container** — non-root, all Linux capabilities dropped, read-only root fs.

> The Node permission model (`--permission`) is intentionally not used: the tool
> must spawn `git`/`gh`, which would require `--allow-child-process` (Node warns
> this invalidates the model), so it adds little over the layers above.

Run the tests, including a hardened pass that runs every test with codegen disabled:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:hardened
```

| `MERGE_METHOD`  | `squash`                 | Merge method when `AUTO_MERGE=true`: `squash`, `merge`, or `rebase`.                                                                                                  |

\* Set **exactly one** of `GH_ORG` or `GH_USER` — not both, not neither.

### Auto-merge

With `AUTO_MERGE=true`, after each PR is opened the tool runs `gh pr merge --<method> --delete-branch`. It **respects branch protection** — a repo that requires reviews or passing checks is left open and listed in the summary (and report) as "auto-merge blocked"; nothing is bypassed. The token must have merge rights on the repo.

### Reports

Every run writes `polinrider-<timestamp>.json` + `.md` (and `latest.json` / `latest.md`) to `REPORTS_DIR` (the mounted `./reports` volume in Docker). The files are rewritten after each repo, so you get a durable, auditable trace — including each repo's findings, what was removed/cleaned, the PR link, and merge status — instead of relying on scrollback. The Markdown includes a clickable **Repository | Pull request | Status** table.

---

## PR branch protection

Because your org has branch protection enforced, the tool:

- Creates a **new branch** per repo (never pushes to `main` or `master` directly)
- Opens a PR for review — a human merges it
- PR body explains exactly what was changed and why

---

## After merging PRs

1. Notify affected developers to check their machines for the initial dropper
2. Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed via committed `.env` files
3. Check npm global packages: `npm list -g --depth=0`
4. Check VS Code extensions for anything unfamiliar
5. Revoke and regenerate any PATs for accounts whose machines were compromised
